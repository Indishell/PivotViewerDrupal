The administration page also allows the administrator to associate PivotViewer with available content types. Click on the 'Save Configuration' button

To embed a PivotViewer control in your content, you need to place the {pivotviewer} macro in the content (Article, Basic Page) text. 
Also, the Text Format of the content (Article, Basic Page) should be set to 'Full HTML'. The macro can be generated by using 
the 'Add PivotViewer' button in the Create content (Article, Basic Page) page. 
 

The 'Add PivotViewer' button is automatically associated with all existing content types like Article and Basic Page. 
To view the button during creation of newly added content types, it has to be associated with the content types.
 

The macro allows users to select the data source which the PivotViewer control should load. This macro should be copied in the content text. 
Once the content (Article, Basic Page) has been saved with the {pivotviewer} macro, a PivotViewer control will be displayed in its place on viewing the content.
